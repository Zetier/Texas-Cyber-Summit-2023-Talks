# FTDI Adapter Boards

This directory contains all relavent information for the FTDI boards for TXCYSUMMIT23. 

### Step 1

Order all relavent parts and equipment from your store of choice. The parts required for this list are in the BOM (bill of materials) that is in this directory. You can search for these parts wherever you like, or try to find them in some junk components you have lying around. You will also need solder, and a solder iron. This will cost a one time fee and does not count against you for the purposes of the beatme price.

After getting all relavent parts and tools, you can start building your board.
