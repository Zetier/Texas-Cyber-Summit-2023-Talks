# OMG Demonseed clones

The OMG Demonseed is an opensource project located [here](https://github.com/O-MG/DemonSeed). It has narratives on youtube [here]() and can be used as an RF triggerable usb implant. It is not even close to having the features of the OMG cable but for a beginner project will suffice. It is very simple and easy to build in kicad. 
# 1) Install Kicad
Kicad can be found [here](https://www.kicad.org/). Debian is sudo apt install kicad or arch sudo pacman -Syu kicad.
