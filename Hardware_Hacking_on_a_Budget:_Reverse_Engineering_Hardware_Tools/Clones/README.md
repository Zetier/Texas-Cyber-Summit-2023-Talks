# OMG Demonseed clones

The OMG Demonseed is an opensource project located [here](https://github.com/O-MG/DemonSeed). It has narratives on youtube [here]() and can be used as an RF triggerable usb implant. It is not even close to having the features of the OMG cable but for a beginner project will suffice. It is very simple and easy to build in kicad. 
# 1) Install Kicad
Kicad can be found [here](https://www.kicad.org/). Debian is sudo apt install kicad or arch sudo pacman -Syu kicad. 
# 2) Open Kicad 
Open a new instance of Kicad. It should look like this the first time you run it.

# 3) Making a new project
To use kicad, a user needs to create a new project. Click file/new project and enter a project name.

A new project should now appear in the left file navigator.

# 4) Jump into new schematic

To open the schematic viewer, simply click on the schematic file.

# 5) Familirization with schematic editor

This is a screenshot of some of the tools used. The naming convention and location of these will be used for the rest of the readme.

# 6) Copying the schematic

In Kicad, it is fairly simple to reverse and clone another schematic. Just drop and place components, edit their values, add a footprint and connect them. Below is the schematic being cloned.

To search for components, click on the symbol browser.

A table like this will pop up. This is where one can search for a particular part that they want in their circuit. In this case searched is the microcontroller, the ATTINY85-20M. After double clicking it should be placed. Click it on the schematic and escape to deselect it and free your mouse

Your schematic should now look like this.
